# Services Automation

## Overview

The Services Automation project aims to automate the checkup and certain validations or functions of services using the NUnit framework along with Selenium. Each flow of test will be tailored for different services based on their specific requirements.

As an initial stage, this project automates an NUnit test that connects to a Portainer account and checks if the containers are up.

## Features

- **Automated Checkup**: Utilizes the NUnit framework and Selenium to automate the checkup process for container services.

## Dependencies

- [NUnit](https://www.nunit.org/): A unit-testing framework for all .NET languages.
- [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/): A tool used for automating web applications for testing purposes.
- [WebDriverManager](https://github.com/rosolko/WebDriverManager.Net): A .NET library for managing WebDriver binaries automatically.
- [WebDriverManager Chrome Driver](https://github.com/rosolko/WebDriverManager.Net): WebDriverManager configuration for ChromeDriver.
- [Selenium Support](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/selenium_support/): Support classes and methods for Selenium WebDriver.
- [Selenium Extras WaitHelpers](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/html/N_SeleniumExtras_WaitHelpers.htm): Additional wait helpers for Selenium WebDriver.

## Setup

To run the automated tests, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/services-automation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd services-automation
   ```

3. Create your own `appsettings.pageobjects.json` file containing the URLs and credentials for your services.

4. Install the necessary dependencies (ensure you have NUnit, Selenium WebDriver, WebDriverManager, Selenium Support, and Selenium Extras WaitHelpers installed):

   ```bash
   # Replace with your package manager command
   dotnet add package NUnit
   dotnet add package Selenium.WebDriver
   dotnet add package WebDriverManager
   dotnet add package Selenium.Support
   dotnet add package SeleniumExtras.WaitHelpers
   ```

5. Run the NUnit tests:

   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

## Automation with Cron

To automate the runtime of the automation and schedule it to run at specific times, you can use cron jobs on Unix-like systems (including macOS and Linux).

### Setting up a Cron Job

A cron job allows you to schedule tasks to run periodically at specified times. You can add a cron job to execute your automation script at specific intervals. Here's an example of how to set up a cron job:

1. Open your terminal and run the following command to edit the crontab file:

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. Add a new line to the crontab file to specify when and how often the script should run. For example, to run the script every day at 6:45 PM, you can add the following line:

   ```cron
   45 18 * * * /path/to/your/script.sh >> /path/to/log/file.log 2>&1
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/your/script.sh` with the path to your bash script and `/path/to/log/file.log` with the path to your log file. This line tells cron to execute the script `script.sh` at 6:45 PM every day and redirect the output to a log file.

3. Save and exit the crontab file. The cron job is now scheduled, and your script will run automatically at the specified time.

### Example Bash Script

Below is an example of a simple bash script that can be used with a cron job to automate the runtime of your automation:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Navigate to the project directory
cd /path/to/your/project/directory

# Run the automation script
dotnet test
```

Replace `/path/to/your/project/directory` with the path to your project directory. This script navigates to the project directory and executes the automation script using the `dotnet test` command.

By combining a cron job with a bash script, you can automate the execution of your automation script at specific intervals.
